# What is an Empathy Map?
An empathy map is a visual and often collaborative exercise used to synthesize qualitative data gathered from the user research phase of the design thinking process. Empathy maps can give us a way to categorize the findings of users' attitudes and behaviors into four subsetted quadrants (Says, Thinks, Does, and Feels). Empathy maps can systematize our discoveries into a decipherable form for not only us but our team as well. This organized approach gives us a more holistic view of our users' problems and needs in a fast and digestible way. However, this technique does not undermine the usage of personas.

## Single vs Multiple Subjects
Empathy maps ordinarily encompass data from a single subject, but they can also reflect an assortment of multiple users when the users exhibit similar behaviors. Aggregate empathy mapping can bring out common themes or patterns among grouped segments.

# Prerequisites and Preparation
After conducting qualitative research through methods such as user interviews, ethnographic field studies, or diary studies, you should now have sufficient user data to begin creating empathy maps. Make sure to clearly define the goals you hope to achieve and the scope in which you are working. You should first have every member of your team read through the research on their own. Additionally, provide adequate contextual information into your users' situation to help your colleagues empathize with them.

Although you can create digital empathy maps through digital services such as Miro's Online Whiteboard, they are better done in person whenever possible. To create an empathy map in person, you will need to prepare the following:
- Research data
- A large whiteboard
- Sticky notes
- Markers
- Timer (optional - for timeboxing)

In addition to the physical requirements, you will need about 30 minutes for this exercise. The session itself shouldn't take very long, but settings up, getting everybody together, and summarizing the findings can take some time.

# Creating an Empathy Map
1. Draw vertical and horizontal lines through the middle of the whiteboard (or paper), with a circle in the middle for your user.
2. Sketch your user in the center circle and write their name and a brief description of who they are and what they do.
3. Write "SAYS" in the top left quadrant, "THINKS" in the top right quadrant, "DOES" in the bottom left quadrant,  and "FEELS" in the bottom right quadrant.
- The **Says** quadrant contains keywords and quotes said by the user during the research phase.
- The **Thinks** quadrant includes what occupies the user's thoughts. Read into their body language to determine if they are too afraid, polite, or unsure about something to extrapolate deeper insights.
- The **Does** quadrant consists of expressed behavior and physical actions performed by the user.
- The **Feels** quadrant encompasses the range of emotions expressed by the user. Take into consideration the user's choice of words, tone of voice, and nonverbal expressions.
4. Begin filling in the map. You can start with the "Says" quadrant and move clockwise around the map. Write one observation per sticky note. Make sure everybody contributes and that you are only writing discoveries from your research and not assumptions.
5. Cluster related sticky notes together within each quadrant and write category names for each of the groupings.

Observations will often be ambiguous and therefore seem to fit multiple quadrants. Don't get caught up in placing sticky notes in the "right" quadrant.

# Synthesizing Your Findings
As you and your team draw conclusions, it is important to discuss your thoughts on the experience. Focus on what drives the users' behavior. Discussing what surprised you the most, what's missing, and common themes among quadrants will leave a long-lasting emotional impact on the participants. Remember, one of the main reasons to do this exercise is to focus on the user's thoughts and feelings and this discussion will reinforce that.

Expressions of cognitive dissonance are to be expected and may surprisingly yield valuable insights. An American psychologist by the name of Abraham Maslow fleshed out this idea of simultaneously holding contradictory beliefs in his book titled *Motivation and Personality* published in 1954. Examining Maslow’s theory of the Hierarchy of Needs may help you unveil some striking revelations from your research.

# Conclusion
Your new insights can help guide you to ideate and innovate solutions for your design problems. Organizing your data this way increases readability which may uncover weaknesses or gaps in your research and helps you better understand what drives your users' behaviors.
