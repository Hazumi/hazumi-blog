# What is an Empathy Map?
An empathy map is a visual and often collaborative exercise used to synthesize qualitative data gathered from the user research phase of the design thinking process. Empathy maps can give us a way to categorize the findings of users' attitudes and behaviors into four subsetted quadrants (Says, Thinks, Does, and Feels). Using empathy maps allows us to gain a more holistic view of our users' problems and needs in a fast and digestible way, allowing us to bring light to those issues through innovative solutions.

# Single vs Multiple Subjects
Empathy maps ordinarily encompass data from a single subject, but they can also reflect an assortment of multiple users when the users exhibit similar behaviors. Aggregate empathy mapping can bring out common themes or patterns among grouped segments. However, this technique does not undermine the usage of personas.

# Prerequisites and Preparation
After conducting qualitative research through methods such as user interviews, ethnographic field studies, or diary studies, you should now have sufficient user data to begin creating empathy maps. Make sure to clearly define the goals you hope to achieve and the scope in which you are working. You should first have every member of your team read through the research on their own.  Provide adequate contextual information into your users' situation to help your colleagues empathize with them.

Although you can create digital empathy maps through services such as Miro's Online Whiteboard, it is ideal to do them in person whenever possible. In order to do them in person you will need to prepare the following items:
- A large whiteboard
- Sticky notes
- Markers
- Timer (optional - for timeboxing)

# Creating an Empathy Map

1. Draw vertical and horizontal lines through the middle of the whiteboard (or paper), with a circle in the middle for your user
2. Write "SAYS" in the top left quadrant, "THINKS" in the top right quadrant, "DOES" in the bottom left quadrant,  and "FEELS" in the bottom right quadrant

- The **Says** quadrant contains keywords and quotes said by the user during the research phase.
- The **Thinks** quadrant includes what occupies the user's thoughts. Read into their body language to determine if they are too afraid, polite, or unsure about something to extrapolate deeper insights.
- The **Does** quadrant consists of expressed behavior and physical actions performed by the user.
- The **Feels** quadrant encompasses the range of emotions expressed by the user. Take into consideration the user's choice of words, tone of voice, and nonverbal expressions.

# Synthesizing Your Findings

Expressions of cognitive dissonance are to be expected and may surprisingly yield valuable insights. An American psychologist by the name of Abraham Maslow fleshed out this idea of simultaneously holding contradictory beliefs in his book titled *Motivation and Personality* published in 1954. Examining Maslow’s theory of the Hierarchy of Needs may help you unveil some striking revelations from your research.
