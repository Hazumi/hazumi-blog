User research is a critical yet often misunderstood step during the creation of a new product. There is even a lot of misconception regarding what user experience actually is. Many people use the terms UX and UI interchangeably, so let's define some of these terms to ensure we're on the same page before getting started.

- **User Experience Design** is the process of designing products and services that are usable, meaningful, and relevant to its users.
- **User Research** is the study of target users to better understand their behaviors, needs, motivations, and frustrations.
- **User Interface Design** is the process of building interfaces for users to interact with, usually with a focus on aesthetics.

Let's take a look at how these processes fit together in the big picture. UX design is the broader term that encompasses many subsets such as user research and UI design. User research happens at the beginning of the discovery stage of the UX design process. This research is essential and should not be skipped or overlooked. It is up to UX designers to advocate for this process for the sake of the users. User research drives future design decisions by framing the real issues faced by users. Without a proper understanding of what users are going through, designers wouldn't be able to understand the problems they are trying to solve. Because of this, UI design must always come sometime after the initial research.

User research should not end once you have defined the problem space. Understanding the needs of your users will provide a solid kick-off point, but you'll need to test constantly throughout the product lifecycle to ensure you retain the optimum user experience. It's important to note that design is not entirely subjective. You can measure different aspects of your design's usability. For example, if users take a while to locate information on your website, then maybe there's an issue with your information architecture. Or maybe users are disproportionately using your website's search feature and rarely the navigation menu. This could indicate some parts of your website's design are confusing for users. The design might make sense to you, but that doesn't mean the same will hold for your users. You're creating a product for a specific user group, not for yourself. If you do not make sure that your product stays on track for solving their needs, you may find yourself designing a product for the wrong audience.

It's not uncommon to feel like you already have a good understanding of the users’ problem space but building an entire product based on those assumptions is a massive gamble. Can you afford to be wrong about those assumptions? There's a good chance that you'll end up wasting a lot of time and money. The initial investment into user research may very well be the difference between the success and failure of a product. Without research, you may even find out you've built a product that nobody even wants. No company wants their product to launch at a disadvantage, especially in this competitive market. User research is the only way to confirm that your design solutions genuinely deliver great experiences for your users. So don't overlook doing the research, but rather build a strong foundation for your product and increase the chances of success for your product with a thorough research process. There are no shortcuts to success.
