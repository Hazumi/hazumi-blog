My name is Nick, and I'm a 31-year-old technology enthusiast currently living in Wilmington, North Carolina. I write about user experience, user interface, interaction design, web development, and psychology. My interest in technology instantly began when I obtained my first computer in my early teens. I started coding my own website within a few years of being introduced to the internet, and my interest has only grown since. I am passionate about using creative, innovative solutions to make the internet more enjoyable and efficient for everybody.
